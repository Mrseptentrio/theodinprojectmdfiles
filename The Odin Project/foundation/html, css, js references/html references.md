# HTML elements reference

This page lists all the [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML) [elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element), which are created using [tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tag). They are grouped by function to help you find what you have in mind easily. An alphabetical list of all elements is provided in the sidebar on every element's page as well as this one.

**Note:** For more information about the basics of HTML elements and attributes, see [the section on elements in the Introduction to HTML article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML#elements_%e2%80%94_the_basic_building_blocks).

## [Main root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#main_root "Permalink to Main root")

Element

Description

[`<html>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html)

The **`<html>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the _root element_. All other elements must be descendants of this element.

## [Document metadata](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#document_metadata "Permalink to Document metadata")

Metadata contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software ([search engines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Search_engine), [browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser), etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or link to another file that has the information.

The **`<section>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.

## [Text content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#text_content "Permalink to Text content")

Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening [`<body>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) and closing `</body>` tags. Important for [accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility) and [SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO), these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content.     

Element

Description

[`<blockquote>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote)

The **`<blockquote>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see [Notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#usage_notes) for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the **cite** attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the `cite` element.

[`<dd>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dd)

The **`<dd>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (`dt`) in a description list (`dl`).

[`<div>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div)

The **`<div>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) is applied to its parent element).

[`<dl>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl)

The **`<dl>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the `dt` element) and descriptions (provided by `dd` elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).

[`<dt>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dt)

The **`<dt>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a `dl` element. It is usually followed by a `dd` element; however, multiple `<dt>` elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next `dd` element.

[`<figcaption>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption)

The **`<figcaption>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent `figure` element.

[`<figure>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure)

The **`<figure>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the `figcaption` element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.

[`<hr>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr)

The **`<hr>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.

[`<li>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li)

The **`<li>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (`ol`), an unordered list (`ul`), or a menu (`menu`). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.

[`<ol>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol)

The **`<ol>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.

[`<p>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p)

The **`<p>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

[`<pre>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre)

The **`<pre>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or "[monospaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font), font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.

[`<ul>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)

The **`<ul>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.

## [Inline text semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#inline_text_semantics "Permalink to Inline text semantics")

Use the HTML inline text semantic to define the meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any arbitrary piece of text.

Element

Description

[`<a>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)

The **`<a>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element (or _anchor_ element), with [its `href` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#href), creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.

[`<abbr>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr)

The **`<abbr>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents an abbreviation or acronym; the optional `title` attribute can provide an expansion or description for the abbreviation.

[`<b>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b)

The **`<b>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use `<b>` for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS `font-weight` property to create boldface text, or the `strong` element to indicate that text is of special importance.

[`<bdi>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/bdi)

The **`<bdi>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of the text being inserted.

[`<bdo>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/bdo)

The **`<bdo>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.

[`<br>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br)

The **`<br>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.

[`<cite>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite)

The **`<cite>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must include the title of that work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.

[`<code>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code)

The **`<code>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, the content text is displayed using the user agent default monospace font.

[`<data>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/data)

The **`<data>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element links a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation. If the content is time- or date-related, the `time` element must be used.

[`<dfn>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dfn)

The **`<dfn>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The `p` element, the `dt`/`dd` pairing, or the `section` element which is the nearest ancestor of the `<dfn>` is considered to be the definition of the term.

[`<em>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em)

The **`<em>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element marks text that has stress emphasis. The `<em>` element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.

[`<i>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i)

The **`<i>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the `<i>` naming of this element.

[`<kbd>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd)

The **`<kbd>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a `<kbd>` element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.

[`<mark>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark)

The **`<mark>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents text which is **marked** or **highlighted** for reference or notation purposes, due to the marked passage's relevance or importance in the enclosing context.

[`<q>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q)

The **`<q>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the `blockquote` element.

[`<rp>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/rp)

The **`<rp>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support display of ruby annotations using the `ruby` element. One `<rp>` element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the `rt` element that contains the annotation's text.

[`<rt>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/rt)

The **`<rt>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. The `<rt>` element must always be contained within a `ruby` element.

[`<ruby>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ruby)

The **`<ruby>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents small annotations that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less common.

[`<s>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/s)

The **`<s>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the `<s>` element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, `<s>` is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the `del` and `ins` elements, as appropriate.

[`<samp>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/samp)

The **`<samp>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as Courier or Lucida Console).

[`<small>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small)

The **`<small>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font-size smaller, such as from `small` to `x-small`.

[`<span>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span)

The **`<span>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the `class` or `id` attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as `lang`. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. `<span>` is very much like a `div` element, but `div` is a [block-level element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements) whereas a `<span>` is an [inline element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements).

[`<strong>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong)

The **`<strong>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.

[`<sub>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/sub)

The **`<sub>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.

[`<sup>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/sup)

The **`<sup>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.

[`<time>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time)

The **`<time>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a specific period in time. It may include the `datetime` attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.

[`<u>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/u)

The **`<u>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.

[`<var>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/var)

The **`<var>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent.

[`<wbr>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/wbr)

The **`<wbr>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.

## [Image and multimedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#image_and_multimedia "Permalink to Image and multimedia")

HTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video.

Element

Description

[`<area>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area)

The **`<area>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines an area inside an image map that has predefined clickable areas. An image map allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with Hyperlink.

[`<audio>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio)

The **`<audio>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the `src` attribute or the `source` element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a `MediaStream`.

[`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img)

The **`<img>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element embeds an image into the document.

[`<map>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map)

The **`<map>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used with `area` elements to define an image map (a clickable link area).

[`<track>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track)

The **`<track>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used as a child of the media elements, `audio` and `video`. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in [WebVTT format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) (`.vtt` files) — Web Video Text Tracks.

[`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video)

The **`<video>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can use `<video>` for audio content as well, but the `audio` element may provide a more appropriate user experience.

## [Embedded content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#embedded_content "Permalink to Embedded content")

In addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can include a variety of other content, even if it's not always easy to interact with.

The **`<noframes>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element provides content to be presented in browsers that don't support (or have disabled support for) the `frame` element. Although most commonly-used browsers support frames, there are exceptions, including certain special-use browsers including some mobile browsers, as well as text-mode browsers.

[`<plaintext>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/plaintext)

The **`<plaintext>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element renders everything following the start tag as raw text, ignoring any following HTML. There is no closing tag, since everything after it is considered raw text.

[`<rb>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/rb)

The **`<rb>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to delimit the base text component of a  `ruby` annotation, i.e. the text that is being annotated. One `<rb>` element should wrap each separate atomic segment of the base text.

[`<rtc>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/rtc)

The **`<rtc>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element embraces semantic annotations of characters presented in a ruby of `rb` elements used inside of `ruby` element. `rb` elements can have both pronunciation (`rt`) and semantic (`rtc`) annotations.

[`<shadow>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/shadow)

The **`<shadow>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element—an obsolete part of the [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) technology suite—was intended to be used as a shadow DOM insertion point. You might have used it if you have created multiple shadow roots under a shadow host. It is not useful in ordinary HTML.

[`<spacer>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/spacer)

The **`<spacer>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is an obsolete HTML element which allowed insertion of empty spaces on pages. It was devised by Netscape to accomplish the same effect as a single-pixel layout image, which was something web designers used to use to add white spaces to web pages without actually using an image. However, `<spacer>` no longer supported by any major browser and the same effects can now be achieved using simple CSS.

[`<strike>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strike)

The **`<strike>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.

[`<tt>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tt)

The **`<tt>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element creates inline text which is presented using the user agent default monospace font face. This element was created for the purpose of rendering text as it would be displayed on a fixed-width display such as a teletype, text-only screen, or line printer.

[`<xmp>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/xmp)

The **`<xmp>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide enough to allow 80 characters per line.
